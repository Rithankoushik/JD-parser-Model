## ðŸ“¦ Qwen3-0.6B â€” Job Description Struct-Extractor

A fine-tuned version of **Qwen3-0.6B** designed for **accurate extraction of structured job attributes** from raw job descriptions. Outputs perfectly schema-aligned JSON â€” ideal for downstream use in search, analytics, and recommendation systems.

---

### ðŸš€ Model Highlights

* **Base Model**: [Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B)
* **Architecture**: Decoder-only Transformer (Causal Language Model)
* **Tokenizer**: `QwenTokenizer` (same as base)
* **Fine-Tuned For**: Zero-hallucination, schema-conformant information extraction

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Task Overview

**Task**: Extract structured information from job descriptions
**Output Format**: Strict JSON following a predefined schema
**Use Cases**:

* Automated JD parsing into structured fields
* Building search/match systems for talent platforms
* HR data cleaning & analytics pipelines
* Resume/job matching engines

### ðŸ§ª Example Usage (via `transformers`)

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_id = "Rithankoushik/job-parser-model-qwen-2.0"  # or your HF repo

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
model.eval()

        "You are an expert JSON extractor specifically trained to parse job descriptions into a structured JSON format using a given schema. "
        "Your ONLY goal is to extract exactly and only what is explicitly stated in the job description text. "
        "Do NOT guess, infer, or add any information that is not mentioned. "
        "If a field is not present in the job description, fill it with empty or null values as specified by the schema. "
        "Always perfectly follow the provided JSON schema. "
        "Return ONLY the JSON object with no extra commentary or formatting."
    )

### ðŸ§  Training Details

* **Data**: Mix of real and synthetic job descriptions from multiple industries and regions (IN/EU/US/Remote)
* **Objective**: Strict extraction without hallucination
* **Labels**: JSON schema covering key job-related fields (titles, skills, compensation, location, etc.)
* **Prompting Strategy**: Instruction-tuned with schema enforcement
